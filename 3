Create an EFS and connect it to 3 different EC2 instances. Make sure that
all instances have different operating systems. For instance, Ubuntu, Red
Hat Linux and Amazon Linux 2

To create an Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) and connect it to 3 EC2 instances (each with a different OS: Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Amazon Linux 2), follow this clear step-by-step guide using the AWS Management Console.

‚úÖ Part 1: Create the EFS File System
Go to the Amazon EFS console.

Click Create file system.

Name it something like shared-efs.

Choose the same VPC that your EC2 instances are (or will be) in.

Click Customize.

In the Network access section:

Add Mount targets in at least 2‚Äì3 Availability Zones (AZs).

Select appropriate subnets and security groups that allow NFS (port 2049).

Leave other settings default or customize (performance, throughput).

Click Create.

‚úÖ Part 2: Launch 3 EC2 Instances
1Ô∏è‚É£ Ubuntu EC2
Choose Ubuntu AMI (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).

Select t2.micro or similar.

Place in the same VPC and subnet as one of your EFS mount targets.

Assign a security group that allows outbound access and allows port 2049 inbound from EFS SG (if needed).

Add a key pair and launch.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Red Hat EC2
Select the Red Hat Enterprise Linux AMI (e.g., RHEL 8).

Repeat steps as above.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Amazon Linux 2 EC2
Choose the default Amazon Linux 2 AMI.

Launch like above.

‚úÖ Part 3: Install NFS Utilities on Each EC2 Instance
üîß Ubuntu
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nfs-common
üîß Red Hat (RHEL)
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
üîß Amazon Linux 2
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
‚úÖ Part 4: Mount the EFS on All EC2 Instances
1. Create a Mount Directory
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mkdir /mnt/efs
2. Mount the EFS
Use this command (replace fs-xxxx with your EFS ID and region):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,tcp,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 fs-xxxxxxxx.efs.<region>.amazonaws.com:/ /mnt/efs
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,tcp,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 fs-12345678.efs.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com:/ /mnt/efs
‚úÖ Part 5: Test Shared Access
On one EC2 instance, create a test file:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Shared EFS works!" | sudo tee /mnt/efs/test.txt
On the other 2 instances:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat /mnt/efs/test.txt
You should see: Shared EFS works! ‚Äî confirming all instances share the same EFS.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Make sure security groups allow NFS (TCP port 2049) between EC2 instances and EFS mount targets.

For persistent mounts, add the mount command to /etc/fstab on each instance.

Would you like help generating the exact mount commands for your region or verifying security group rules?

Great! Let‚Äôs walk through what you need to generate the exact EFS mount commands and verify the required security group settings.

‚úÖ 1. Info I Need from You
Please provide:

EFS File System ID
(e.g., fs-12345678)

Region where EFS and EC2 are running
(e.g., eu-west-2, us-east-1, etc.)

VPC or Security Group IDs (optional but helpful for SG checks)

üõ†Ô∏è 2. In the Meantime, Here's a Template
Once I get the exact details, I‚Äôll fill in the blanks. For now, here‚Äôs a template you‚Äôll be using on each EC2 instance:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/efs
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,tcp,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 fs-<EFS-ID>.efs.<region>.amazonaws.com:/ /mnt/efs
üîê 3. Security Group Configuration
You need to ensure the EC2 security group allows NFS traffic outbound, and the EFS security group allows it inbound.

‚úÖ Security Group Rule for EFS
In EFS‚Äôs security group, add:

Type: NFS

Protocol: TCP

Port Range: 2049

Source: The security group attached to your EC2 instances
(or their IPs/CIDR block if using different SGs)

üì• Example (Once I Get Your Info)
Assume:

EFS ID: fs-0abc123456789def0

Region: us-east-1

Here‚Äôs the exact mount command:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/efs
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,tcp,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2 fs-0abc123456789def0.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /mnt/efs
Please provide your:

‚úÖ EFS ID

‚úÖ AWS region

‚úÖ (Optional) EC2 and EFS Security Group IDs

Once I have that, I‚Äôll give you the ready-to-run commands and confirm if your SGs are configured properly.
