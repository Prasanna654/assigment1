# Step 1: Update packages
sudo apt-get update -y

# Step 2: Install NFS client
sudo apt-get -y install nfs-common

# Step 3: Create a directory to mount the EFS
sudo mkdir /efs

# Step 4: Mount the EFS to /efs (replace the DNS with your EFS endpoint if different)
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0df91a5c9dc35f4fd.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /efs

# Step 5: Check if EFS is mounted (FIXED the wrong dash in original)
sudo df -h

# Step 6: Navigate into the EFS mount and create a test file
cd /efs
sudo touch ubuntu-file.txt



# Step 1: Update the system packages
sudo yum update -y

# Step 2: Install NFS utilities
sudo yum -y install nfs-utils

# Step 3: Create a directory to mount EFS
sudo mkdir /efs

# Step 4: Mount the EFS using DNS (make sure the EFS DNS is in the same region)
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0df91a5c9dc35f4fd.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /efs

# Step 5: Verify that the EFS is mounted correctly
sudo df -h  # FIXED: Use hyphen `-`, not en dash `–`

# Step 6: Go into the mounted directory
cd /efs

# Step 7: Create a test file to confirm write access
sudo touch amazon-linux-file.txt

# Step 1: Update the system packages
sudo yum update -y

# Step 2: Install NFS utilities
sudo yum -y install nfs-utils

# Step 3: Create a directory to mount the EFS
sudo mkdir /efs

# Step 4: Mount the EFS using its DNS name (ensure it's in the same region as the instance)
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0df91a5c9dc35f4fd.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /efs

# Step 5: Check that the EFS mount was successful
sudo df -h  # FIXED: replaced en dash (–) with a correct hyphen (-)

# Step 6: Navigate to the mounted EFS directory
cd /efs

# Step 7: Create a test file to verify write access
sudo touch redhat-linux-file.txt  # FIXED: extension was
