Problem Statement:
You work for XYZ Corporation. Their application requires a storage service that
can store files and publicly share them if required. Implement S3 for the same.
Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Create an S3 Bucket for file storage.
2. Upload 5 objects with different file extensions.

Here’s how you can manually implement the requested tasks for XYZ Corporation’s S3 storage:

1. Create an S3 Bucket
Steps in AWS Console:

Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.

Click Create bucket.

Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., xyz-corp-storage).

Choose the AWS region (preferably close to your users).

Leave other options as default or configure as needed (e.g., versioning, encryption).

Click Create bucket.

2. Upload 5 objects with different file extensions
Steps in AWS Console:

Open your created bucket.

Click Upload.

Select files from your computer with different extensions, e.g.:

report.pdf

image.png

data.csv

notes.txt

presentation.pptx

Click Upload.

Bonus: Make files publicly accessible (if required)
Select the uploaded object.

Go to Permissions tab.

Under Public access, click Edit.

Check Everyone (public access) → Allow Read.

Save changes.

Optional: Using AWS CLI
If you prefer command line:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Create bucket
aws s3 mb s3://xyz-corp-storage --region eu-west-2

# Upload files
aws s3 cp report.pdf s3://xyz-corp-storage/
aws s3 cp image.png s3://xyz-corp-storage/
aws s3 cp data.csv s3://xyz-corp-storage/
aws s3 cp notes.txt s3://xyz-corp-storage/
aws s3 cp presentation.pptx s3://xyz-corp-storage/
Would you like me to help you generate a Terraform or CloudFormation script for automating this?

Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Enable versioning for the bucket created in task 1.
2. Re-upload any 2 files already uploaded to verify if versioning works

ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here’s a clear manual and AWS CLI guide to enable versioning on your existing S3 bucket and verify it by re-uploading files:

1. Enable Versioning on your S3 Bucket
Using AWS Console:
Open S3 service in AWS Console.

Select your bucket (e.g., xyz-corp-storage).

Go to Properties tab.

Scroll down to Bucket Versioning.

Click Edit.

Choose Enable.

Save changes.

Using AWS CLI:
bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket xyz-corp-storage --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
2. Re-upload 2 files to verify versioning
Choose any two files you previously uploaded (e.g., report.pdf and image.png).

Using AWS Console:
Go to the bucket.

Upload new versions of these files with the same names.

S3 will keep previous versions automatically.

Using AWS CLI:
bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3 cp report.pdf s3://xyz-corp-storage/
aws s3 cp image.png s3://xyz-corp-storage/
3. Verify versioning is working
In the S3 bucket console, enable Show versions (top right corner).

You should see multiple versions for the files you re-uploaded.

Or use CLI to list versions:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket xyz-corp-storage --prefix report.pdf
If you want, I can help you automate this with Terraform or write a script to upload files and enable versioning too!

Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Use the created bucket in the previous task to host static websites, upload
an index.html file and error.html page.
2. Add a lifecycle rule for the bucket:
a. Transition from Standard to Standard-IA in 60 days
b. Expiration in 200 days

ChatGPT said:
Got it! Here’s a clear step-by-step guide to set up static website hosting on your existing S3 bucket and add a lifecycle rule:

1. Host Static Website on Existing S3 Bucket
Upload index.html and error.html files:
Open your S3 bucket in the AWS Console.

Click Upload and upload both index.html and error.html.

Enable static website hosting:
Go to Properties tab of your bucket.

Scroll down to Static website hosting.

Click Edit.

Select Enable.

Enter index.html as Index document.

Enter error.html as Error document.

Save changes.

Make your files publicly accessible (required for website to be accessible):
Select index.html and error.html files in the bucket.

Under Permissions, edit to allow Public read access to these files.

Alternatively, update the bucket policy (see below).

Example Bucket Policy to allow public read access for website hosting:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadForWebsiteContent",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::xyz-corp-storage/*"
    }
  ]
}
2. Add Lifecycle Rule to Bucket
Using AWS Console:
Go to the Management tab of your bucket.

Scroll down to Lifecycle rules.

Click Create lifecycle rule.

Name it e.g., Standard-to-IA-expiration-rule.

Choose Apply to all objects or specify prefix if needed.

Add Transition action:

Transition to Standard-IA after 60 days.

Add Expiration action:

Expire objects after 200 days.

Review and Create rule.

Optional: Using AWS CLI for Lifecycle rule (JSON file example)
Create a file lifecycle.json with:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "StandardToIAAndExpiration",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": {},
      "Transitions": [
        {
          "Days": 60,
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
        }
      ],
      "Expiration": {
        "Days": 200
      }
    }
  ]
}
Then apply with:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket xyz-corp-storage --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json
If you want, I can generate Terraform code for this full setup as well. Just ask!

Great! Here’s a Terraform configuration snippet that:

Enables static website hosting on your existing S3 bucket

Uploads index.html and error.html (you need to provide local files)

Sets a bucket policy for public read access

Adds a lifecycle rule to transition objects after 60 days to Standard-IA and expire after 200 days

hcl
Copy
Edit
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "xyz_bucket" {
  bucket = "xyz-corp-storage"  # Use your existing bucket name

  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "xyz_bucket_policy" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xyz_bucket.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Sid       = "PublicReadForWebsiteContent"
      Effect    = "Allow"
      Principal = "*"
      Action    = ["s3:GetObject"]
      Resource  = ["${aws_s3_bucket.xyz_bucket.arn}/*"]
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "xyz_bucket_lifecycle" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xyz_bucket.id

  rule {
    id     = "StandardToIAAndExpiration"
    status = "Enabled"

    transition {
      days          = 60
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }

    expiration {
      days = 200
    }
  }
}

# Upload index.html
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "index_html" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xyz_bucket.id
  key    = "index.html"
  source = "path/to/your/index.html"   # Change to your local file path
  acl    = "public-read"
  content_type = "text/html"
}

# Upload error.html
resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "error_html" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.xyz_bucket.id
  key    = "error.html"
  source = "path/to/your/error.html"   # Change to your local file path
  acl    = "public-read"
  content_type = "text/html"
}
How to use:
Replace "xyz-corp-storage" with your actual bucket name.

Replace "path/to/your/index.html" and "path/to/your/error.html" with the real paths on your machine.

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform init
terraform apply
This will:

Enable static website hosting on your bucket

Upload your index.html and error.html with public-read access

Set lifecycle policy for transition and expiration

Apply a bucket policy that allows public read for website files
