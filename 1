Great! You're essentially asking to design a scalable cloud architecture using AWS services that:

Automatically adds/removes compute resources based on CPU load.

Distributes traffic using a load balancer.

Routes traffic to your system efficiently.

Let’s break it down step-by-step in simple, clear actions you can manually set up in the AWS Console.

✅ 1. Set Up Auto Scaling Based on CPU Usage
This ensures your system automatically scales up/down depending on CPU load.

A. Create a Launch Template
Go to EC2 Dashboard → Launch Templates → Create launch template.

Fill in:

Name: web-app-template

AMI: Choose the Amazon Linux or your custom image.

Instance type: e.g., t3.micro or as per your needs.

Key pair, security group, IAM role, etc.

Click Create launch template.

B. Create an Auto Scaling Group
Go to EC2 Dashboard → Auto Scaling Groups → Create Auto Scaling group.

Select your launch template.

Choose a VPC and subnets (2 or more AZs recommended).

Click Next until you get to "Set scaling policies".

C. Set Scaling Based on CPU Utilization
Choose Target tracking scaling policy.

Click Create a policy:

Policy type: Add a target tracking policy.

Metric type: Average CPU utilization

Target value: 70% (this keeps it balanced between 80% and 60%)

It will:

Scale out if CPU > 80%

Scale in if CPU < 60% (automatically adjusts around your target)

You can also use step scaling for more precise thresholds (ask if you want help with that).

✅ 2. Create a Load Balancer
This distributes traffic across your instances.

A. Go to EC2 → Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer
Choose Application Load Balancer (best for web traffic).

Name: company-lb

Scheme: internet-facing

Select 2 or more Availability Zones and subnets.

Security Group:

Allow HTTP (port 80) and/or HTTPS (port 443).

Listener: Port 80 (default).

Target Group:

Create a new target group.

Type: Instance

Protocol: HTTP

Register your Auto Scaling Group instances (automatically managed).

Review and Create.

✅ 3. Route Traffic to the Company
Option A: Using Route 53 (Recommended)
Go to Route 53 → Hosted Zones → Create/Select your domain.

Create a Record Set:

Type: A – IPv4 address

Alias: Yes

Alias Target: Select your Application Load Balancer

Save record.

Now traffic to www.company.com will go to your Load Balancer, which will route it to healthy instances.

🔁 Summary
Step	Description
✅ 1	Launch template + Auto Scaling group
✅ 2	CPU-based scaling: >80% → scale out, <60% → scale in
✅ 3	Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic
✅ 4	Route traffic using Route 53
